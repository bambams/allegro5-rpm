This project is intended to provide and maintain an RPM package for
version 5 of the Allegro game programming library. I'm new to RPM so it
will probably be slow going trying to get an RPM made, but hopefully I'll
learn something in the process. Contributors are very welcome!

The way that I'm currently organizing this:

Use rpmdev-setuptree to create your ~/rpm tree if you haven't already:

  $ rpmdev-setuptree

This should leave you with the following directories in ~/rpm:

BUILD
RPMS
SOURCES
SPECS
SRPMS

Clone this repository to where ever you wish to work on it. I've
personally got the Allegro source checked out into
~/src/allegro/${version}, so I've created this repository right next to
that: ~/src/allegro/rpm.

Then, create an absolute path symbolic link from any .spec files in the
repository to the SPECS directory of your ~/rpm:

  $ for f in ~/src/allegro/rpm/*.spec; do
      ln -s $f ~/rpm/SPECS/$(basename $f);
    done

Download the source tarball for Allegro and stick it in the ~/rpm/SOURCES
directory.

Or, just execute the included init.sh script, which will do all
of these things for you. I've tried to make it as smart and safe as
possible, but it might still do "damage" so USE AT OWN RISK.

We can now build the SRPM and RPMs, but none of them have been tested yet.
