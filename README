This project is intended to provide and maintain an RPM package for
version 5 of the Allegro game programming library. We've made it into
Fedora 13 and 14; and should soon be in Fedora 15 as well.

== Installing Allegro 5 in Fedora ==

If you're just trying to install Allegro 5 in Fedora then you've probably
come to the wrong place. This project is for maintaining the RPM
package(s) that are built for Allegro 5 in Fedora. At this time we've
gotten the package into the stable updates repository for Fedora 13 and
Fedora 14. If you're using either of these releases of Fedora then you
should be able to install Allegro by following the directions here:

== The RPM ==

The way that I'm currently organizing this:

Use rpmdev-setuptree to create your ~/rpm tree if you haven't already:

  $ rpmdev-setuptree

This should leave you with the following directories in ~/rpm:

BUILD
RPMS
SOURCES
SPECS
SRPMS

Clone this repository to where ever you wish to work on it. I've
personally got the Allegro source checked out into
~/src/allegro/${version}, so I've created this repository right next to
that: ~/src/allegro/rpm.

Then, create an absolute path symbolic link from any .spec files in the
repository to the SPECS directory of your ~/rpm:

  $ for f in ~/src/allegro/rpm/*.spec; do
      ln -s $f ~/rpm/SPECS/$(basename $f);
    done

Download the source tarball for Allegro and stick it in the ~/rpm/SOURCES
directory.

Or, just execute the included init.sh script, which will do all
of these things for you. I've tried to make it as smart and safe as
possible, but it might still do "damage" so USE AT OWN RISK.
